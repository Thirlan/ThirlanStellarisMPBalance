## Min-Max tweaks

### Changes
 * Negotiate with crime lord: will behave like Stefan's balance mod. Periodic check to see if crime is above 0. Otherwise it will cancel it.

### Nerfs
 * Droids Tech: Tech cost 6000 from 8000
 * Habitats: 1750 alloys from 1500 alloys

Revisited the +X to leadership skills:
 * Max unmodified leadership is 4 from 5
 * Leadership cap is now 15 from 10

 Reducing the starting leadership cap and increasing the max cap increases the value of the leadership traits and venerable trait.

Revisited the +X starbase civics:
 * Base unmodified starbases max cap is reduced to 2 from 3
 * Starbase capacity system multiplier reduced to 0.08 from 0.10 (So for every 100 systems you will get +8 starbases instead of +10)
 * Trading Posts: reverted back to normal
 
 Reducing the number of available stations increases the value of the starbase civics, techs and ascension perks.

The lastest addition to the patch is an anti-rush mechanic. At game start, every human played empire gets a temporary 15 year bonus:

 * Starbase damage +33%
 * Starbase upgrade cost -33%
 * Defense platform build cost -33%
 
The purpose of this change is to:
a) Encourage players to eliminate AIs first
b) Force players to take advantage of the discounts to build defenses

If a player doesn't take advantage of the discounts then when the years are up they are on their own. It is up to them to decide how to invest those resources.

"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery"

Having found that Stefan had his own Balance Mod our group took some time to investigate it. Ultimately Stefan's balance mod would be considered a complete overhaul of the game and not a simple balance patch. As such there is still a desire to approach the game with a simpler patch. Stefan's mod has plenty of ideas and interesting ways to balance things and as such some of these ideas have been incorporated here.
