## 0.1.0

Patch has been used in a few multiplayer games successfully so upgrading to version 0.1.0

Also patching ring world with machines. Stephan has presented a brutal exploit which shows that energy as a penalty is not enough for ring world robots. As such we mixed the penalty to be a combination of energy, research and mineral penalty for the first 30 years.

Also rebalancing the Necrophage origin along with its combination of Fanatical Purifier. Stefan's videos on Necrophage indicate it is clearly very strong on its own.

Also removing modifications to Charismatic, Repugnant, Emotion Emulator and Uncanny. The general agreement was the modifications were non-intuitive and it isn't simple to modify the modifications in the game files, as such even though these are unbalanced traits we will simply leave them as is.

Common grounds effect has also been swapped out from +10 stability to two new events, "Live long and prosper", which will give the player first an additional science ship, scientist and +125 influence around 6 months into the game. The second time the event triggers it will give a construction ship 6 months after the first event along with another +125 influence. These events give the player the ability to avoid being squeezed in by their starting neighbors.
