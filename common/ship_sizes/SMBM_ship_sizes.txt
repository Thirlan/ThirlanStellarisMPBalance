# modifier = { } For non-starbase ships, only takes the following modifiers:
#	hull, shield & armor add/mult and regen add perc/static
#	evasion add/mult
#	speed/base speed mult
#	weapon damage mult
#	upkeep mult
#	For other modifiers, use ship_modifier = { }
# use_shipnames_from = other_size # allows a ship size to use names from another size

		#ship_size_military_1 is default. The following sprite keys are generated from it:
			#GFX_text_<key>
			#GFX_<key>
			#GFX_<key>_top
			#GFX_<key>_top_damaged
# icon_frame: now only used for starbases. Value of 2 or more means it shows up on the galaxy map, 1-5 denote which icon it uses on starbase sprite sheets (e.g. gfx/interface/icons/starbase_ship_sizes.dds)
