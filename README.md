## Introduction
Welcome! This mod is simple and focuses only on nerfing or boosting existing game mechanics. No huge changes are involved nor ever considered. We want this mod to be easy to turn on and off.

The remainder of this document will go over much of the process used for deciding what and how to balance:

1. Why was this mod created?
2. What is the process used to balance mechanics?
3. How will the mod be maintained?

You can refer to the [patch notes](patch_notes.md) to see the full balance list.


## Why was this mode created?
This mod was originally created because the Stellaris development team was extremely slow at addressing glaringly obvious balance issues with the game in regards to multiplayer. As of late with Lem 3.1 the Stellaris Custodian team has done a good job, but we are still a bit far from having issues resolved. This mod hopes to address the issues with quick and easy tweaks so that people can enjoy the game more and worry less about about whether they are min-maxing correctly.

## What is the process used to balance mechanics?

What is balanced, what is not balanced and how changes are made will be done with a rough set of rules as indicated below:

1. Keep it Simple
2. Nerf overpowered mechanics
3. Boost underpowered mechanics

Please read on to understand exactly what these points mean.

### Keep it Simple
The first objective of this mod is to KEEP IT SIMPLE and impact as little as possible to avoid breaking other aspects of the game. The reasons for doing this are the following:

1. We don't want to mess with the AI's logic
2. We want this mod to be EASY to maintain from version to version
3. We don't want to constantly release changes
4. We don't want the mod to crash people's games

Thus any decision to balance something will focus on the worst offenders and will be done in the simplest and most straightforward way possible.

### Nerf Overpowered mechanics
Very self-explanatory. We will nerf those mechanics that are universally considered S class (overpowered). Anything that is A or lower will not be nerfed. 

How do we decide what is S powered? This will be done after reviewing personal feedback from several players, youtube videos explaining exploits from established members of the community (such as Stefan Anon), chats on the Stellaris forums and so on forth.

### Boost Underpowered mechanics
Some mechanics are overpowered because others are RELATIVELY underpowered. Hence some of the clearly underpowered mechanics will be given boosts.

What is decided to be underpowered will be done in much of the same way as what is decided to be overpowered.

## How will the mod be maintained?

This mod will be maintained on a monthly basis in the following manners:

1. Active testing
2. New Stellaris Patches
3. Tweaking

### Active Testing

As an active member of Stellaris we do play the game and will be using this mod. As such it will be tested regularly and whenever an issue is discovered it will be fixed.

### New Stellaris Patches

If Stellaris fixes an issue with a patch, the mod will be updated to remove fixed mechanics.

If there is an upcoming patch that will be released in ~2 weeks then changes will be postponed until after the patch. Expect the mod to be updated after the first weekend after the patch.

### Tweaking

This will be done infrequently to make sure the mod is stable and reliable for everyone.
