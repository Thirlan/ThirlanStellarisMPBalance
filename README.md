# Thirlan's Stellaris Multiplayer Balance Mod

## Introduction
Welcome to this multiplayer balance mod. This is an independently maintained mod with very narrow and specific objectives. This document will go over the following topics:

1. Why was this mod created?
2. What is the process used to balance mechanics?
3. How will the mod be maintained?

## Why was this mode created?
This mod was created because the Stellaris development team have shown to be extremely slow at addressing glaringly obvious issues with the game. This mod hopes to address the glaringly obvious issues with quick and easy tweaks.

## What is the process used to balance mechanics?

What is balanced and what is not balanced will be done with a rough set of rules as indicated below:

1. Keep it Simple
2. Nerf overpowered mechanics
3. Boost underpowered mechanics

Please read on to understand exactly what these points mean.

### Keep it Simple
The first objective of this mod is to KEEP IT SIMPLE and change as little as possible to avoid impacting other aspects of the game. The reasons for doing this are the following:

1. We don't want to mess with the AI's logic
2. We want this mod to be EASY to maintain from version to version
3. We don't want to constantly release changes
4. We don't want the mod to crash people's games

Thus any decision to balance something will focus on the worst offenders and will be done in the simplest and most  straightforward way possible.

### Nerf Overpowered mechanics
Very self-explanatory. We will nerf those mechanics that are universally considered S class (overpowered). Anything that is A or lower will not be nerfed. 

How do we decide what is S powered? This will be done after reviewing personal feedback from several players, youtube videos explaining exploits from established members of the community (such as Stefan Anon's), chats on the Stellaris forums and so on forth.

### Boost Underpowered mechanics
There is no light without shadow, which is to say some mechanics are overpowered because others are RELATIVELY underpowered. Just as some overpowered mechanics will be nerfed, some of the clearly underpowered mechanics will be given boosts.

What is decided to be underpowered will be done in much of the same way as what is decided to be overpowered. We will reach out to the community and get a feel for what is never used because it is just so bad.


## How will the mod be maintained?

This mod will be maintained on a monthly basis in the following manners:

1. Active testing
2. New Stellaris Patches
3. Tweaking

### Active Testing

As an active member of Stellaris we do play the game and will be using this mod. As such it will be tested regularly and whenever an issue is discovered it will be fixed.

### New Stellaris Patches

If Stellaris fixes an issue with a patch, the mod will be updated to remove any tweaks done.

If there is an upcoming patch that will be released in ~2 weeks then changes will be postponed until after the patch. Expect the mod to be updated 2-4 days after the patch.

### Tweaking

We will try to err on the side of caution when making tweaks as such things may be revisited if the tweak was considered insufficient after testing.

This will be done infrequently to make sure the mod is stable and reliable for everyone.
