## Min-Max tweaks

### Nerfs
 * Negotiate with crime lord: New events have a chance of occuring every year for every planet that has negotiated with crime lord. The event will cause the following:
  ** 4% chance: Crime wave event
  ** 2% chance: End of crime lord deal and Criminal Underworld event. Criminal Underworld can stack with Crime Wave.
 * Robotic Workers Tech: Tech cost 4000 from 3000
 * Droids Tech: Tech cost 8000 from 6000
 * Habitats: 1750 alloys from 1500 alloys
 * Be careful out there: All players (AIs not included) start with a passive 33% boost to starbase damage, -33% starbase upgrade cost, -33 defense platform build cost for the first 15 years of the game.
 
### Boosts
 * Gene Clinics: healthcare worker +8% pop growth from +5%
 * Base Leader skill cap: 4 from 5 (Reduction in base cap makes all skill cap traits, techs and ascension perks more valuable)
 * Leadership max cap: 15 from 10 (Increasing leadership cap makes all skill cap traits, techs and ascension perks more valuable)
 * Starbase capacity base amount: 2 from 3 (Reducing starting starbases makes all starbase cap civics, ascensions and techs more valuable)
 * Starbase capacity system multiplier: 0.08 from 0.10 (Reducing starbases makes all starbase cap civics, ascensions and techs more valuable)
 * Clerks: produce 2.2 trade from 2.0 and 2.2 amenities from 2.0
 * Crime/Deviancy per pop: 2.1 from 2
   ** Increasing crime slightly makes slavery less valuable
   ** Increasing crime slightly makes enforcers more required, which reduces tech snowball
   ** Increasing crime slightly makes Negotiate with Crime lord less valuable as an exploit
