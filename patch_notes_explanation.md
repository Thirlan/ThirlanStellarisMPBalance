# Patch Notes Explanation

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to give a high level overview as to why some things have been nerfed or buffed. This is also to keep the patch notes document clean and simple. Some of the patches will be considered self-explanatory and as such details will not be provided unless requested.

## Source material

Following videos were used to determine those mechanics that needed to be balanced. Some of these videos will be dated, but their fundamentals have not changed too much from version to version. In the event the game has changed radically or a better video has been posted then the video links will be updated.

## Tech Rushing and population

Tech rushing and population growth is still THE meta of the game, though population growth has started to take more of a back seat depending on the build chosen. Megacorporations and Void Dwellers can often eschew growth related traits.

## Total War Assimilators

Total War Assimilators (Determined Assimilators, Fanatical Necrophage) that can declare unrestricted wars have always been strong in Stellaris. The reason for their strength is that they are able to quickly gain more populations through their unrestricted conquest, something that normal empires have to spend large amounts of influence to do and as such their speed of conquest is capped. This is not so for the Total war Assimilators, which can conquer an entire empire, giving them a huge boost to power and then allowing them to conquer the next empire in short order.

The simplest fix for this is to reduce the speed at which assimilation happens and thus the creation of new population through conquest.

### Fanatical Purifier Necrophage

This origin and civics combination creates an unholy matrimony of two game mechanics that should not be together. It provides the unrestricted conquest mechanics and buffs of a devouring swarm or determined exterminator with the ability to assimilate like a determined assimilator. Normally devouring swarm or determined exterminator gain these huge combat boosts at the cost of destroying any pops they conquer, but in this case the combination of Fanatical Purifier and Necrophage gives the best of both worlds, which is a noticeable advantage.

Because of this, there is a special event, "Unholy matrimony", at game start that will apply a purge penalty simply because of how powerful this combination is.

## Army buffs

Armies are a very minor element of Stellaris. They are only relevant if you are attacking or defending. When attacking, they are only revelant if you have naval superiority and if you are defending they are only relevant if you have naval inferiority. Overall it wouldn't be far fetched to say they are only 5% of the time spent in Stellaris for the average player. This limitation on game impact means that all game choices that buff armies have less of a chance of making an impact on the outcome of the game as say a bonus to mineral production. This in turn means that overall these are weak simply by nature of the game design.

In this regard, it is unclear why Paradox was so timid with the army buff game choices. Take the resilient trait, which gives +50% army damage to defending army units. This essentially means that if you have 2 defensive units on the planet, then the 50% buff implies there are ~2.5 units on the planet (not 3 because all we did was buff damage and not health or morale). Considering that most people invade with stacks of at least 10, the 50% buff is not even noticeable. On top of this, this buff only helps if you are being invaded, which would mean you have lost naval superiority and very likely have lost the game. The Resilient trait is what would be considered a losing power, which is to say it only comes into effect when you are losing.

As of late Stellaris has made some changes to some of the Army game choices like Strength of Legions or Warbots. There are still some though such as Resilient that are not given much attention.

## Be careful out there (event)

One of the events added to this patch is the anti-rush event. Unlike an RTS, Stellaris is a long game and no one wants to be knocked out in the first few minutes of the game.

This is a temporary event that reduces the cost of defensive modules and gives a slight starbase attack boost. This helps provide early defenses for the players, while also encouraging them to build defenses before the boost fades. A player that fails to take advantage of these and chooses to push all resources into tech rushing is then solely responsible for their own death after these bonuses fade.

The boost also only applies to players and not AIs, which also encourages players to attack AIs first before killing their fellow gamers.

## AI Trade exploitation

As the game has become more complicated and the choices multiply, the number of ways to exploit the AI's weaknesses has increased. The most noticeable one in the game so far is through trade deals and none more abusive than the Imperial Fiefdom origin. Due to these exploits various game attributes have been tweaked to prevent the AI from accepting weak trade deals and being sucked dry of all resources. For example, it is harder to improve relationships in general with the AI using Embassies. The AI is also less willing to engage in one sided tech trade deals.

## Racial traits

Some people may noticed that the racial traits have some unusual changes to them. The argument might have been to just reduce the point cost. There are some reasons for not having done this.

The first reason is that changing point costs of traits will affect the existing races that people have created and come with the game. This falls foul of our KISS principle of making the sure the mod is simple to use and easy to turn on and off. Hence no changes to point costs will EVER be made and requires us to instead modify the abilities directly.

The bonuses cannot be large enough to skew how the AI should normally use these races. AI game files are hardcoded to weigh each racial trait to determine how to use them. Our KISS principle is not to change many game files and as such it is best to give a minor buff or nerf.
