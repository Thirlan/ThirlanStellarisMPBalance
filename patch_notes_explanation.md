# Patch Notes Explanation

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to give a high level overview as to why some things have been nerfed or buffed. This is also to keep the patch notes document clean and simple. Some of the patches will be considered self-explanatory and as such details will not be provided unless requested.

## Source material

Following videos were used to determine those mechanics that needed to be balanced. Some of these videos will be dated, but their fundamentals have not changed too much from version to version. In the event the game has changed radically or a better video has been posted then the video links will be updated.

## Terminology

Throughout the document we will be using some lingo to generalize entire concepts of the game. This section will help to explain this lingo.

Game choices: choices that the players make/select that affect the game. For the most part this will pertain to racial traits, ascension perks, technology, civics and traditions.

Return on Investment (ROI): The general concept of how much you get back for investing in something. If you buy something for $10 and sell it for $15 your return on investment is $5. Just introducing the acronym to get this out of the way.

Unrestricted war: The ability to declare war on anyone with the ability to conquer their territory without expending influence.

## Tech Rushing and population

Tech rushing and population growth is still THE min-max meta of the game, even though Nemesis did balance population mechanics very slightly. In this regard, nerfs have been applied to the usual suspects of tech rushing and population growth game choices. Namely two small nerfs to the Expansion tradition, a nerf to the Technological Ascendency ascension perk and a nerf to the Xenophobe ethic.

## Unrestricted Assimilators

Unrestricted Assimilators (Determine Assimilators, Fanatical Necrophage and Barbaric Necrophage) that can declare unrestricted wars have always been strong in Stellaris. The reason for their strength is that they are able to quickly gain more populations through their unrestricted conquest, something that normal empires have to spend large amounts of influence to do and as such their speed of conquest is capped. This is not so for the Unrestricted Assimilators, which can conquer an entire empire, giving them a huge boost to power and then allowing them to conquer the next empire in short order.

The simplest fix for this is to reduce the speed at which assimilation happens and thus the creation of new population through conquest. The normal rate of assimilation is based on the speed of purging, which is roughly 1 population every 5 months. Thus assimilators create 5 population a month after conquering a planet, which is never penalized by the total population size. It is very easy to see that this is MUCH faster than the rate someone can make pop through robots or clone vats. The fix then is to impose a -25% penalty to purging for the Unrestricted Assimilators, which will translate into a pop growth of 1 every 6.7 months. 

This nerf will also make it slightly harder for such empires to digest larger empires as an empire with a planet of 50 pop will take 28 years to assimilate instead of 20.

### Fanatical Purifier Necrophage

This origin and civics combination creates an unholy matrimony of two game mechanics that should not be together. It provides the unrestricted conquest mechanics and buffs of a devouring swarm or determined exterminator with the ability to assimilate like a determined assimilator. Normally devouring swarm or determined exterminator gain these huge combat boosts at the cost of destroying any pops they conquer, but in this case the combination of Fanatical Purifier and Necrophage gives the best of both worlds, which is a noticeable advantage.

Because of this, there is a special event, "Unholy matrimony", at game start that will apply a -33% purge penalty simply because of how powerful this combination is.

## Leadership cap

Many of the leadership cap game choices are considered very weak due to how little of a buff it gives throughout the game. It can be trivial to reach the leadership cap of 10 through various racial traits, technologies, ascension perks, traditions and even civics. Hence once someone reaches 10, all the other leadership cap game choices lose some or all of their value.

The leadership cap bonuses also loses some of its value since most leaders will often plateau at 5, with or without a cap bonus, because of experience gains and mortality. In addition, the % gains for going from 5 to 6 are less (20%) than the gains from going from 4 to 5 (25%).

Due to this, one of the simpler ways of buffing the leadership cap game choices has been to reduce the standard cap on leader levels from 5 to 4 and increase the maximum cap from 10 to 15.

## Army buffs

Armies are a very minor element of Stellaris. They are only relevant if you are attacking or defending. When attacking, they are only revelant if you have naval superiority and if you are defending they are only relevant if you have naval inferiority. Overall it wouldn't be far fetched to say they are only 5% of the time spent in Stellaris for the average player. This limitation on game impact means that all game choices that buff armies have less of a chance of making an impact on the outcome of the game as say a bonus to mineral production. This in turn means that overall these are weak simply by nature of the game design.

In this regard, it is unclear why Paradox was so timid with the army buff game choices. Take the resilient trait, which gives +50% army damage to DEFENSIVE army units only. This essentially means that if you have 2 defensive units on the planet (one of the weakest units in the game other than slaves I might add), then the 50% buff implies there are ~2.5 units on the planet (not 3 because all we did was buff damage and not health). Considering that most people invade with stacks of at least 8, the 50% buff is not even noticeable. On top of this, this buff only helps if you are being invaded, which would mean you have lost naval superiority and very likely have lost the game. The Resilient trait is what would be considered a losing power, which is to say it only comes into effect when you are losing.

It is not very hard to see then that all the army buff game choices have similar issues and explains the reason why they have all been buffed. Buffing army health is especially important as it also helps the army units to survive orbital bombardment, which helps act as a delaying mechanism if your navy is not close enough. It also helps units to survive combat, which reduces the costs of armies and increase experience gains, which provides for a better return on investment over time.

## Crime

Crime is a frequently exploited game mechanic. As seen in some of the more recent videos by Stefan, both for the Crime Lord Deal and during his Hive Mind play in the Nemesis Cold War videos, you can regularly have high crime with little to no risk.

The quickest tweak that can thus be done for this is to increase slightly the crime/deviancy per pop from 2.0 to 2.2. This is only a 10% adjustment and will be left this way until it is determined how much of an impact this really has. Preliminary testing has shown that it does push some starting empires (e.g. slave with decadent) from 0% to ~5% crime rate at the start of the game, but this seems to have little to no impact.

These changes to crime also indirectly give a boost to the Domination tradition, known to be the weakest tradition tree.

## Be careful out there (event)

One of the events added to this patch is the anti-rush event. Unlike an RTS, Stellaris is a long game and no one wants to be knocked out in the first few minutes of the game. This event is an alternative method to the one done by Stefan's Mod, which introduces a new building in the starbase of the capital system. The building modification permanently alters the landscape by making the capital systems fortresses. It also allows for people to more comfortably tech rush. This is neither KISS nor a desired behavior of the players. Tech rushing is already strong.

The alternative then is to make it a temporary event that boosts the starbases and reduces the cost of upgrading starbases and defensive modules. This helps provide early defenses for the players, while also encouraging them to build defenses for when the boost fades. A player that fails to take advantage of these and chooses to push all resources into tech rushing is then solely responsible for their own death after these bonuses fade.

The boost also only applies to players and not AIs, which encourages players to attack AIs first before killing their fellow gamers.

## Racial traits

Some people may notice that the racial traits have some unusual changes to them. For example Venerable has +2% unity and +2% social. The argument might have been to just reduce the point cost or increasing the longevity. There are two reasons for not having done this.

The first reason is that changing point costs of traits will affect the existing races that people have created and come with the game. This falls foul of our KISS principle of making the sure the mod is simple to use and easy to turn on and off. Hence no changes to point costs will EVER be made and requires us to instead modify the abilities directly.

The second reason on whether to just increase longevity has to do with longevity in the game in general. +80 is a significant boost already, and any additional years added have diminishing returns. Consider that by the end of the game your citizens can live to 130 without this boost. The game itself only lasts about 300 years so adding another 20 years does not really justify the 4 point cost of Venerable. Instead it is more logical to add some minor bonuses that have the right flavor to the trait.

The bonuses added to Venerable however cannot be large enough to skew how the AI should normally use these races. AI game files are hardcoded to purposefully weigh each racial trait to determine how best to use them. Our KISS principle is not to change many game files and as such it is best to give two minor buffs instead of one large buff and thus explains why it is just a tiny 2% here for two traits.

Another question will be about Repugnant and Emotion Simulator traits, which also have unusual changes instead of the stat being directly modified. Turns out that the amenities modification trait is a very complicated game mechanic that is referenced 50+ times in 6 files. This is very different than the other racial traits that are simple modifiers in just the species trait files. Trying to change all references is thus too much effort and violates the KISS principle. Instead a small flavorful change is added to the trait directly.
